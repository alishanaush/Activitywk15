# Titanic Dataset

The Titanic Problem is based on the sinking of the ‘Unsinkable’ ship Titanic in the early 1912. It gives you information about multiple people like their ages, sexes, sibling counts, embarkment points and whether or not they survived the disaster.

This dataset has 891 instances and 11 features

This Dataset is used to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
